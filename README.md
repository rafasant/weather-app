# Weather Application

- This is a very simple weather application to showcase my skills with web development.
- This application was first written by youtuber Hamza Mirza as a part of his API crash course.

# What I Learned

- Developed a simple unresponsive user interface
- Parse data from an API (open weather map) into a JSON file
- Use React to create a rather dull but functional single page application to show the weather in your area
